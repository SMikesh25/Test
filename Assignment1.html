        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p> Hello! I am Sean Mikesh, a second year student at
                <a href="https://www.elon.edu/">Elon University</a> pursuing a BFA in Acting and a minor in Communications.<br>
                Firstly, Let me thank you for stopping by my page.
                 I have a lot to share with the world, and I figured this website could be the perfect way to get to know me.<br>
                  I want to use this website to present both the professional and personal sides to who I am.<br>
                  I am a team player, hard worker, and empathetic artist</p>

            <h2>Professional </h2>
                <p>My previous work experience does not include any internships yet, but I am looking towards trying to intern either for theaters in the D.C. area <br>or through the Washington Center.
                I have worked several jobs over the course of my professional life, however.<br> All of which provided me with experience, stories, and connections.</p>
                
                <h3> Work Experience</h3>
                    <p> Previous work experience includes:</p> 
                      <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> 
                        <br> Donation Attendent at Goodwill
                        <br>  Performer at Youthful Diversions
                        <br> Sandwich Artisan at Jersey Mike's</p>

                       <p><br>These very different jobs provided wide exposure in customer service, efficiency, and cohesion.
                     I believe these could be a great foundation for future internships.</p>

                <h3> Volunteering</h3>
                    <p>In additon to working these jobs, I've had the oppurtunity to volunteer back in VA and at Elon during the academic semester.
                        <br> Some of my volunteer experience comes from working in the theater as a stagehand, usher, and audition day helper at Elon.
                        <br>Some other volunteering oppurtunities took place at local schools and churches where I helped teach camps.
                    <br>Learning to teach and support subjects that I am passionate about has been a wonderful gift for my acting career.</p>

              <h2>Personal Life</h2>
              <img src="/IMG_4588.JPEG" width="450" height="600">
                <p> I was born in Seattle, Washington, but I have lived and grown up in Northern VA for most of my life (about 40 minutes outside of D.C.).
                    <br>From a young age, I knew that I was going to find a passion in anything that let me express my thoughts fully, and my connection to my family and close friends supported me.
                     Especially my mother and father.
                     <br> Where I grew up and my community of loved ones helped shaped me into who I am. 
                     <br> I enjoy spending time outside, music production, Improv Comedy, and recently, I've been quite interested with Watercolor+ Multimedia Visual Art.
                     <br>I would describe myself as fun, empathetic, and a thinker. My favorite places to be are the studio, the theater, or anywhere with sun</p>

        <h3> Acting</h3>

        <a href="https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/arts-and-sciences/performing-arts/"
            target="_blank">Elon Performing Arts</a>
            <p> I am currently honing my craft at 
                <a href="https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/arts-and-sciences/performing-arts/" target="_blank">Elon University</a>
                (as I stated earlier in the Introduction) which offers an in-depth exploration of the craft without latching me down to a Conservatory style program.
                <br> My teachers have helped to prepare me with various tools for my technique including practice and exercises linked to meisner and stanislovsky work.
                <br>  In addition to this, vocal production and movement have been a vital focus of my collegiate training.
                <br> I am currently studying with Libby Otos and learning how to take intiative for my own technique. 
                <br> Also feel free to check out Instant Laughter, Elon's premiere improv comedy troupe that I am a member of.</p>

        <h3> Music</h3>
            <p>Although I was involved with Musical Theatre for a lot of my childhood, this is a relativley new endeavor for me.
                <br> I have begun composing some indie rock, hip-hop, and experimental music with Logic Pro X and posting the work to Soundcloud.
                <br> I'm hoping to keep working on my songwriting and compositions so I have another outlet besides Theatre.
                <br> Keep up with my Soundcloud here: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mikeshmusic" target="_blank">Mikesh on Soundcloud!</a> </p>
                <br>
